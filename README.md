#### The core idea

SellMyServices is a platform to match `service seekers` to `service sellers`. A normal flow is-

1. User installs our [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.varunon9.sellmyservices)
2. In the App he searches for some services. Let's say he is looking for a `freelancer`.
3. All the `freelancers` active in his nearby area (range 50 KM) would be populated on google map.
4. He can browse individual search results and check their description, ratings, location etc.
5. He can contact them if interested via email/mobile/chat for a deal.
6. A few days later - after having freelancing service, he can submit feedback or rate that service on our platform.

#### How does it work?

1. A seller is a person who offers some service e.g. Photographer, Carpenter, Cook, Teacher, Doctor, Freelancer etc.
2. Seller register his services on our platform.
3. A seeker is a person who is in search of some service(s) e.g. a person looking to hire cook.
4. Seekers search services on our platform.
5. SellMyServices list all the nearby sellers who are offering services searched by seeker. 
6. Seeker then can browser seller's services, their ratings, location etc and if interested can directly chat to sellers.
7. After availing a service, a seeker can share feedback and rating to corresponding seller on our platform.
